# ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
This simple tool for drawing lines on a canvas was written using JS to manipulate the 2D context of an HTML element.    
The equation used to create a line was written by me, and behaves like existing functions provided by the canvas itself.  
The aim of this code is to put into practice the concepts learned during the Analytical Geometry course in Electronic Engineering.

> When you activate 'Debug line', the line is printed to the console.

# ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
  
A LINE CAN BE WRITTEN BY THE VECTOR EQUATION OF THE LINE USING THE CONCEPTS OF ANALYTIC GEOMETRY.  
  
TO FORM A LINE YOU NEED  
           
1- A point and a Director Vector  
OR  
2- Two points  
          
> Let 'P' be a point distinct from 'G' and 't' be a scalar used to segment the line through time.    
> We define the directing vector V as P in the direction of G, so (G - P)  
> Giving rise to the equation:  
  
> (x, y) = p + t * v  
        
Isolating the coordinates, we get  
           
> x = Px + t * Vx  
> y = Py + t * Vy
